  ##Dyslexia Detection Through Handwriting Analysis
The objective of this project is to automatically detect indicators of dyslexia from handwritten text images and assist users by:
  - Identifying dyslexia-related writing patterns such as spelling errors, phonetic mistakes, letter transpositions, and inconsistent spacing
  - Generating corrected and more readable text using a language model when dyslexia is detected
This system is intended to support early screening and assistance, not to provide a medical diagnosis.
